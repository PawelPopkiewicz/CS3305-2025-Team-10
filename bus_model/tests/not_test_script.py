    Idea: Store sufficient context to allow us to build a full SQL query from a syntax such as trip.route.stop, where all we have to specify is the initial ID
    Context needed:
    - The query so far
        - Depth, variables used
    - table names
    - initial ID
    Precomputation:
    - Find which keys to join on (e.g. connections between route and trip table in either direction need to used route_id key.)
    - Maybe get all headers and overlaps between tables is the key to match on.
    - Have a look-up table which will tell us the key to join on
    - Invalid pairs can also raise impossible actions
